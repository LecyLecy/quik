# Project Overview

This is a **Next.js + Supabase notes/chat app** that lets users create, edit, and manage text notes, images, videos, GIFs, and documents.
The app supports rich media previews, countdown notes, fullscreen modal previews, and robust UI/UX for both mobile and desktopâ€”similar to LINE/WhatsApp.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-type notes: text, image, GIF, video, document
- Countdown note with live countdown display
- Media upload with Supabase Storage (`notes-media` bucket)
- Grid preview (with gallery modal if >4 contents)
- Fullscreen modal for images/videos/GIFs
- Document/gif/video preview (with play icon overlay for video)
- Clickable links in notes (`react-linkify`)
- Safe update, delete (also deletes from Supabase Storage)
- Select-mode to bulk select & delete notes (multi-select UI)
- Optimistic UI: notes update immediately on add/edit/delete
- Responsive layout: grid adapts to mobile & desktop
- "Scroll to bottom" button, sticky header
- Disabled buttons & input validation (file naming, select mode)

**Context for GitHub Copilot:**
This is a mobile-first notes/chat app with rich media support, built with Next.js + Supabase.
UI must be robust for both desktop and mobile, all actions safe, async, and reflect instantly in UI.
All logic should be written clean, in Typescript, with reactivity for notes state.
Copilot should help with robust hooks, UI/UX flows, and edge-case handling!

for output, i want to to ask me for more detail if you are unsure, make sure i agree on what you are about to do, make sure what im thinking is the same as you, just ask me for anything like screenshot, file, etc or ask me like "do you want it to be like this or this"
